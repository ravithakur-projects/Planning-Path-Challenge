# Planning-Path-Challenge
Carla's at a fork in the road and she insists on making the optimal choice for which way to go. This is a classic example of a search problem. In this situation, the optimal path is the shortest path.

Carla has two choices:

Go Left - in which case she will travel a total distance of L3 + L4.

Go Right - in which case she will travel a total distance of L1 + L2.

Complete the function below so that it returns the string L when option 1 is a shorter distance and returns the string R when option 2 is shorter. If the two options are the same it can return either L or R.
